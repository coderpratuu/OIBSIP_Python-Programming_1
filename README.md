# OIBSIP_Python-Programming_1

📌 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a Random Password Generator using Python. The application generates secure passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length and character types.

The project demonstrates the use of randomization, input validation, GUI development, and basic security principles to create strong and customizable passwords.

🛠 Tools and Technologies Used

Python 3

Tkinter (for GUI development)

Random Module (for generating random characters)

String Module (for handling character sets)

🧱 Project Structure

GUI Interface for:

Password length input

Character type selection (letters, numbers, symbols)

Excluding specific characters

Password generation logic

Password strength indicator

Clipboard integration

⚙️ Steps Performed
1️⃣ GUI Design

Designed a simple and user-friendly interface using Tkinter.

Added input fields for password length.

Included checkboxes for selecting character types.

Added buttons for generating and copying the password.

Displayed password strength indicator.

2️⃣ Random Password Generation

Used the random module to select characters randomly.

Used the string module to access:

Letters (uppercase and lowercase)

Digits

Special characters

Combined selected character sets based on user preferences.

3️⃣ Input Validation

Ensured password length is a valid number.

Enforced minimum length requirement.

Required at least one character type to be selected.

Handled invalid inputs with error messages.

4️⃣ Security Rules Implementation

Ensured at least one character from each selected type is included.

Added strength indicator based on:

Length

Inclusion of letters

Inclusion of numbers

Inclusion of symbols

5️⃣ Clipboard Integration

Implemented copy-to-clipboard functionality.

Allowed users to quickly copy generated passwords.

🔄 How the Application Works

User enters desired password length.

User selects character types (letters, numbers, symbols).

Optional: User excludes specific characters.

Application generates a random password.

Password strength is displayed.

User can copy the password to clipboard.

✅ Key Features

Customizable password length

Multiple character type selection

Character exclusion option

Password strength indicator

Clipboard copy feature

Error handling and validation

Clean and simple GUI


🚀 Outcome

The final outcome is a functional and user-friendly Password Generator application that creates secure and customizable passwords.

The project successfully combines beginner-level programming concepts (randomization and input handling) with intermediate-level GUI development and basic security implementation.
